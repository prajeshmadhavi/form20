# Missing Assembly Constituencies Report

## Summary
Out of 288 expected Assembly Constituencies (AC_1 to AC_288):
- **Available**: 286 ACs
- **Missing**: 2 ACs

## Missing ACs

### AC_66
- **Expected Location**: Between AC_65 (Gondia) and AC_67 (Gadchiroli)
- **Status**: No PDF file in source dataset
- **Likely Reason**: Reserved/skipped constituency number in official Maharashtra assembly numbering

### AC_258
- **Expected Location**: Between AC_257 (Satara) and AC_259 (Satara)
- **Status**: No PDF file in source dataset  
- **Likely Reason**: Reserved/skipped constituency number in official Maharashtra assembly numbering

## Conclusion
These 2 constituencies (AC_66 and AC_258) appear to be intentionally skipped or reserved numbers in Maharashtra's official assembly constituency numbering system. They were never part of the source dataset.

**Actual processing completion**: 286/286 available constituencies = 100%
