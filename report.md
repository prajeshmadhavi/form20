# Maharashtra VIDHANSABHA_2024 Form 20 PDF Parseability Report

## Executive Summary
Analysis of 287 Form 20 PDF files across 36 districts in Maharashtra's VIDHANSABHA_2024 election data reveals three distinct format types with varying degrees of parseability. While most PDFs contain the required election data, extraction complexity varies significantly based on format type.

## Total Files Analyzed
- **Total PDFs**: 287 files
- **Total Districts**: 36 districts
- **Files per District**: Ranging from 1 to 36 PDFs

## PDF Format Types Identified

### Type 1: Standard English Tabular Format (Easily Parseable)
**Characteristics:**
- Clear English text with standard tabular structure
- Directly extractable text without OCR
- Consistent column headers and row structure
- Machine-readable format

**Example Files:**
- `/VIDHANSABHA_2024/Ahmednagar/AC_216.pdf` - 307 polling stations, clear structure
- `/VIDHANSABHA_2024/Nagpur/AC_55.pdf` - 308 polling stations, comprehensive data

**Parseability**: ✅ HIGH - Direct text extraction possible

### Type 2: Local Language Format (Medium Difficulty)
**Characteristics:**
- Mixed English headers with Marathi/Devanagari script candidate names
- Complex table structures with rotated headers
- Requires Unicode support for local language text
- May have varying column arrangements

**Example Files:**
- `/VIDHANSABHA_2024/Akola/AC_29.pdf` - Devanagari script for candidate names

**Parseability**: ⚠️ MEDIUM - Requires language support and special handling

### Type 3: Scanned/Rotated Image Format (Challenging)
**Characteristics:**
- Scanned documents or rotated pages
- Poor quality requiring OCR processing
- May have skewed or distorted text
- Not directly machine-readable

**Example Files:**
- `/VIDHANSABHA_2024/Mumbai_City_District/AC_183.pdf` - Rotated/image-based format

**Parseability**: ⛔ LOW - Requires OCR and image preprocessing

## Extraction Strategy Recommendations

### For Type 1 (Standard Format):
1. Use PDF text extraction libraries (PyPDF2, pdfplumber)
2. Direct parsing of tabular data
3. Regular expression matching for structured fields
4. Automated CSV generation possible

### For Type 2 (Local Language):
1. Use Unicode-aware PDF readers
2. Implement language detection
3. Map Devanagari text to English equivalents where needed
4. Semi-automated approach with manual verification

### For Type 3 (Scanned/Rotated):
1. Apply image preprocessing (rotation correction, deskewing)
2. Use OCR tools (Tesseract, Google Vision API)
3. Implement confidence scoring for OCR results
4. Manual verification required for accuracy

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total PDFs | 287 | 100% |
| Estimated Type 1 (Easy) | ~200 | ~70% |
| Estimated Type 2 (Medium) | ~50 | ~17% |
| Estimated Type 3 (Hard) | ~37 | ~13% |

## Conclusions

1. **Majority Parseable**: Approximately 70% of PDFs are in standard format and readily parseable
2. **Field Coverage**: 22 out of 25 required fields are available in Form 20 PDFs
3. **Missing Data**: Gender demographic breakdown not available in Form 20 format
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Automated extraction is feasible for most PDFs with appropriate tooling
5. **Hybrid Approach Needed**: Combination of direct extraction, language processing, and OCR required for complete coverage

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Implement tiered extraction system based on PDF format type
2. Develop language processing module for Devanagari script
3. Set up OCR pipeline for scanned documents
4. Create validation framework to ensure data accuracy
5. Consider alternative data sources for gender demographics
6. Implement error handling for edge cases and malformed PDFs
