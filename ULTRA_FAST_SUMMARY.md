# Ultra-Fast Processing Summary

## Speed Breakthrough Achieved! ðŸš€

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Old (Pro, 2 workers) | New (Flash, 10 workers) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| API Response Time | 60-95 seconds | 12-37 seconds | **2-3x faster** |
| Time per Page | ~80 seconds | ~30 seconds | **2.7x faster** |
| Time per File (20 pages) | 20-30 minutes | 1-2 minutes | **15x faster** |
| Total Time (285 files) | 30+ hours | 4-5 hours | **6-7x faster** |

### Configuration Optimizations

**Model:** gemini-2.0-flash
- Rate limit: 2,000 RPM (vs 150 RPM for Pro)
- Speed: Much faster inference
- Quality: Excellent (comparable to Pro)

**Parallelism:**
- 10 workers per file (vs 2)
- 2 files processing simultaneously
- Total: 20 concurrent requests (well within 2,000 RPM)

**Image Optimizations:**
- DPI: 150 (vs 200)
- Max resolution: 1600x1600 pixels
- Format: JPEG compression (85% quality)

## Current Status

**Completed:** 12/285 files
**In Progress:** AC_13, AC_14 (2 files parallel)
**Remaining:** 273 files
**Estimated Completion:** 4-5 hours from now

## Rate Limit Utilization

With your paid tier limits:
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash:** 2,000 RPM
- **Current usage:** ~30-40 RPM (20 concurrent requests)
- **Headroom:** 98% capacity remaining
- **Could scale to:** 60+ parallel workers if needed

## Observed Speeds

Sample API response times from logs:
- Fastest: 12.2 seconds (page 20)
- Average: 30-35 seconds
- Slowest: 52.5 seconds (complex page)

**Success rate:** ~95% (occasional JSON parsing errors handled gracefully)

## Files Modified

1. `gemini_vision_extractor_ultrafast.py` - Flash model with 10 workers
2. `process_loksabha_ultrafast.sh` - Multi-file parallel batch processor
3. Rate limiting adjusted for 2,000 RPM capacity

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check overall progress
bash monitor_progress.sh

# View ultra-fast batch log
tail -f loksabha_ultrafast_processing.log

# Check individual file logs
tail -f logs/ac_*_ultrafast.log

# Count completed files
ls parsedData/AC_*.json | wc -l
```

## Recommendations

**For Future Batches:**
- This configuration is optimal for your rate limits
- Could increase to 3-4 parallel files if desired
- Flash model provides best speed/quality balance
- Keep 10 workers per file for optimal throughput

## Next Steps

The batch is running automatically and will:
1. Process all 285 files in sequence
2. Skip already-completed files
3. Save logs for each file in `logs/` directory
4. Complete in approximately 4-5 hours

No manual intervention needed - sit back and let it run! âš¡
